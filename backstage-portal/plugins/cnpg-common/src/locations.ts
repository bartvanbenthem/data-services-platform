 * Locations: the Kubernetes clusters the platform runs data services in; the

 * crossplane-api/apis/location) with the settings below, pointing at a
 * Secret on the control plane (namespace `cnpg.locations.namespace`) that
 * holds its kubeconfig under the `kubeconfig` key. The Location composition
 * creates the provider-kubernetes ClusterProviderConfig the Project and
 * PostgresCluster compositions place objects through. The kubeconfig never
