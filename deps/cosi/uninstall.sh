# (see install.sh). The COSI CRDs and controller stay, and with them every
# BucketClaim, BucketAccess and Bucket: a driver installed later (any
# namespace) picks them up again. Until then nothing gets granted or revoked.
#
# REMOVE_CRDS=true also deletes the CRDs and the controller, only once no
# Bucket is left (deleting a CRD deletes all its objects).
